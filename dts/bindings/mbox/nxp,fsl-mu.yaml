    description: |
      Number of receive channels enabled on this instance.
      Setting this value to N, will enable channels 0 to N-1, consecutively.
      It should be set by the receiver core coupled with this MRU instance.

      For example, if receiver A wants to Rx on channels 0 and 1, then A must
      set rx-channels of mruA as follows:

        mruA {
          rx-channels = <2>;
          status = "okay";
        };
